Hello World!
I'm committing to a 100 days of code challenge to force myself to more consistency.
I'm not a total beginner so I'm hoping to get through the first two or three weeks fairly easily.
My aim is to make it a habit to code more often in my free time when I don't have to do assignments.
Therefore, all programs and code snippets I'll be contributing into the 100 days of code challenge 
won't be part of any university-related compulsory tasks.

I'm not following one exact challenge roadmap because I found that my personal goals somewhat differ 
from any of the premade challenges that are out there. Instead I've looked through multiple resources 
and made my own plan.
